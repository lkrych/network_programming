# RAX, ECX, EDX, EBX -> General-purpose registers: Accumulator, Counter, Data, Base
# these registers act as temporary variables for the CPU when it is executing machine instructions

# RSP, RBP, RSI, RDI -> General-purpose registers, but known as Pointers and Indexes. The first two are known
# as pointers because they store 32-bit addresses, which essentially point to that location in memory
# the last two registers are used to point to the source and destination when data needs to be read from or written to

# RIP -> Instruction Pointer Register, points to the current instruction the processor is reading

# RFLAGS -> consists of several bit flags that are used for comparisons and memory segmentations
