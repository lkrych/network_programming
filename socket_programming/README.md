Simple client-server implementations done in conjunction with reading Computer Networking from the top down (Kurose and Ross)

All implementations were modified to use Python 3.7

1. The client will read a line of characters from the keyboard and send the data to the server
2. The server will receive the data and convert the characters to uppercase
3. the server sends the modified data back to the client
4. The client receives the modified data and display the lines on its screen
